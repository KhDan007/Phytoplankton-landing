                        <strong>Phytoplankton</strong> (/ˌfaɪtoʊˈplæŋktən/) are the <a

                        components
                        of
                        the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton">plankton</a> community and a key part
                        of
                        ocean and freshwater <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ecosystem">ecosystems</a>.
                        The
                        name comes from the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language">Greek</a> words
                        φυτόν
                        (phyton), meaning '<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant">plant</a>', and πλαγκτός
                        (planktos), meaning 'wanderer' or 'drifter'.<sup>[1][2][3]</sup> <br>

                        Phytoplankton obtain their energy through <a
                            href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, as do trees
                        and
                        other
                        plants on land. This means phytoplankton must have light from the sun, so they live in the
                        well-lit
                        surface layers (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphotic_zone">euphotic zone</a>)
                        of
                        oceans
                        and lakes. In comparison with terrestrial plants, phytoplankton are distributed over a
                        larger
                        surface area, are exposed to less seasonal variation and have markedly faster turnover rates
                        than
                        trees (days versus decades). As a result, phytoplankton respond rapidly on a global scale to
                        climate
                        variations.<br>

                        Phytoplankton form the base of marine and freshwater food webs and are key players in the
                        global
                        <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle">carbon cycle</a>. They account for
                        about
                        half of global photosynthetic activity and at least half of the oxygen production, despite
                        amounting
                        to only about 1% of the global plant biomass. Phytoplankton are very diverse, varying from
                        photosynthesizing bacteria to plant-like <a

                        Important groups of phytoplankton include the <a

                        groups are represented.<sup>[2]</sup> <br>

                        Most phytoplankton are too small to be individually seen with the <a

                        enough numbers, some varieties may be noticeable as colored patches on the water surface due
                        to
                        the

                    The effects of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropogenic_warming">anthropogenic
                        warming</a> on the global population of phytoplankton is an area of active research.
                    Changes
                    in
                    the vertical stratification of the water column, the rate of temperature-dependent
                    biological
                    reactions, and the atmospheric supply of nutrients are expected to have important effects on
                    future
                    phytoplankton productivity.[20][21]<br>

                    The effects of anthropogenic ocean acidification on phytoplankton growth and community
                    structure
                    has
                    also received considerable attention. The cells of coccolithophore phytoplankton are
                    typically
                    covered in a calcium carbonate shell called a <a
                        href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccolithophore#Coccolithophore_shells">coccosphere</a>
                    that is sensitive to ocean acidification. Because of their short generation times, evidence
                    suggests
                    some phytoplankton can adapt to changes in pH induced by increased carbon dioxide on rapid
                    time-scales (months to years).[22][23]<br>

                    Phytoplankton serve as the base of the aquatic food web, providing an essential ecological
                    function
                    for all aquatic life. Under future conditions of anthropogenic warming and ocean
                    acidification,
                    changes in phytoplankton mortality due to changes in rates of <a
                        href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooplankton">zooplankton</a> grazing may be
                    significant.[24] One of the many <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain">food
                        chains</a> in the ocean – remarkable due to the small number of links – is that of
                    phytoplankton
                    sustaining <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill">krill</a> (a <a
                        href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean">crustacean</a> similar to a tiny
                    shrimp),
                    which in turn sustain <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen_whale">baleen
                        whales</a>.<br>

                    The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles in the Equatorial Pacific area can affect
                    phytoplankton.[25] Biochemical and physical changes during ENSO cycles modify the
                    phytoplankton
                    community structure.[25] Also, changes in the structure of the phytoplankton, such as a
                    significant
                    reduction in biomass and phytoplankton density, particularly during El Nino phases can
                    occur.[26]
                    The sensitivity of phytoplankton to environmental changes is why they is often used as
                    indicators of
                    estuarine and coastal ecological condition and health.[27] To study these events satellite
                    ocean
                    color observations are used to observe these changes. Satellite images help to have a better
                    view of
                    their global distribution.[25]

                                In the early twentieth century, <a

                                    Redfield</a> found the similarity of the phytoplankton's elemental composition to

                                dissolved nutrients in the deep ocean.[33] Redfield proposed that the ratio of carbon to
                                nitrogen to
                                phosphorus (106:16:1) in the ocean was controlled by the phytoplankton's requirements,
                                as
                                phytoplankton subsequently release nitrogen and phosphorus as they are remineralized.
                                This
                                so-called

                                diverge
                                due to the changes in exogenous nutrient delivery[35] and microbial metabolisms in the

                                The dynamic stoichiometry shown in unicellular algae reflects their capability to store
                                nutrients in
                                an internal pool, shift between enzymes with various nutrient requirements and alter

                                composition.[36][37] Different cellular components have their own unique stoichiometry
                                characteristics,[34] for instance, resource (light or nutrients) acquisition machinery
                                such
                                as
                                proteins and chlorophyll contain a high concentration of nitrogen but low in phosphorus.
                                Meanwhile,
                                growth machinery such as ribosomal RNA contains high nitrogen and phosphorus
                                concentrations.<br>

                                Based on allocation of resources, phytoplankton is classified into three different
                                growth
                                strategies, namely survivalist, bloomer[38] and generalist. Survivalist phytoplankton
                                has a
                                high

                        proportion of
                        growth machinery, and is adapted to exponential growth. Generalist phytoplankton has similar
                        N:P
                        to
                        the Redfield ratio and contain relatively equal resource-acquisition and growth machinery.

                        Study).
                        The
                        study focused on the sub-arctic region of the North Atlantic Ocean, which is the site of one
                        of
                        Earth's largest recurring phytoplankton blooms. The long history of research in this
                        location,
                        as
                        well as relative ease of accessibility, made the North Atlantic an ideal location to test
                        prevailing
                        scientific hypotheses[39] in an effort to better understand the role of phytoplankton
                        aerosol
                        emissions on Earth's energy budget.[40]<br>

                        NAAMES was designed to target specific phases of the annual phytoplankton cycle: minimum,
                        climax
                        and
                        the intermediary decreasing and increasing biomass, in order to resolve debates on the
                        timing of
                        bloom formations and the patterns driving annual bloom re-creation.[40] The NAAMES project
                        also
                        investigated the quantity, size, and composition of aerosols generated by <a

                        The diagram on the right gives an overview of the various environmental factors that
                        together
                        affect
                        <a>phytoplankton productivity</a>. All of these factors are expected to undergo significant
                        changes
                        in the future ocean due to global change.[50] Global warming simulations predict oceanic
                        temperature
                        increase; dramatic changes in <a>oceanic stratification</a>, circulation and changes in
                        cloud
                        cover
                        and sea ice, resulting in an increased light supply to the ocean surface. Also, reduced
                        nutrient
                        supply is predicted to co-occur with ocean acidification and warming, due to increased
                        stratification of the water column and reduced mixing of nutrients from the deep water to
                        the
                        surface.[51][45]

                                In the diagram on the right, the compartments influenced by phytoplankton include the
                                atmospheric
                                gas
                                composition, inorganic nutrients, and trace element fluxes as well as the transfer and
                                cycling

                                organic matter via biological processes. The photosynthetically fixed carbon is rapidly
                                recycled
                                and
                                reused in the surface ocean, while a certain fraction of this biomass is exported as
                                sinking
                                particles to the deep ocean, where it is subject to ongoing transformation processes,
                                e.g.,
                                remineralization.[52]

                                Phytoplankton contribute to not only a basic pelagic marine food web but also to the
                                microbial
                                loop.
                                Phytoplankton are the base of the marine food web and because they don't rely on other
                                organisms
                                for
                                food, they make up the first trophic level. Organisms such as zooplankton feed of these
                                phytoplankton which are fed on by other organisms and so forth until the fourth trophic
                                level is
                                reached with apex predators. Approximately 90% of total carbon is lost between trophic
                                levels
                                due to
                                respiration, detritus, and dissolved organic matter. This makes the remineralization

                                nutrient cycling performed by phytoplankton and bacteria important in maintaining
                                efficiency.[53]

                    <p>Phytoplankton are a key food item in both <a

                        phytoplankton
                        as food for the animals being farmed. In mariculture, the phytoplankton is naturally
                        occurring
                        and
                        is introduced into enclosures with the normal circulation of seawater. In aquaculture,
                        phytoplankton
                        must be obtained and introduced directly. The plankton can either be collected from a body
                        of
                        water
                        or cultured, though the former method is seldom used. Phytoplankton is used as a foodstock
                        for
                        the

                            global plant biomass.[57] In comparison with terrestrial plants, marine phytoplankton are
                            distributed over a larger surface area, are exposed to less seasonal variation and have
                            markedly
                            faster turnover rates than trees (days versus decades).[57] Therefore, phytoplankton respond

                            is complicated by phytoplankton bloom cycles that are affected by both bottom-up control
                            (for
                            example, availability of essential nutrients and vertical mixing) and top-down control (for

                            grazing and viruses).[58][57][59][60][61][62] Increases in solar radiation, temperature and

                            production, but only when nutrients are not limiting.[64][65][66][24]

                        Some studies indicate that overall global oceanic phytoplankton density has decreased in the
                        past
                        century,[67] but these conclusions have been questioned because of the limited availability
                        of
                        long-term phytoplankton data, methodological differences in data generation and the large

                        decadal variability in phytoplankton production.[68][69][70][71] Moreover, other studies

                        a
                        global increase in oceanic phytoplankton production[72] and changes in specific regions or
                        specific
                        phytoplankton groups.[73][74] The global Sea Ice Index is declining,[75] leading to higher

                        penetration and potentially more primary production;[76] however, there are conflicting

                        for the effects of variable mixing patterns and changes in nutrient supply and for
                        productivity
                        trends in polar zones.[62][24]<br><br>

                        The effect of human-caused <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">climate
                            change</a> on phytoplankton biodiversity is not well understood. Should greenhouse gas
                        emissions
                        continue rising to high levels by 2100, some phytoplankton models predict an increase in <a
                            href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_richness">species richness</a>, or the
                        number
                        of
                        different species within a given area. This increase in plankton diversity is traced to
                        warming
                        ocean temperatures. In addition to species richness changes, the locations where
                        phytoplankton
                        are
                        distributed are expected to shift towards the Earth's poles. Such movement may disrupt
                        ecosystems,
                        because phytoplankton are consumed by zooplankton, which in turn sustain fisheries. This
                        shift
                        in
                        phytoplankton location may also diminish the ability of phytoplankton to store carbon that
                        was
                        emitted by human activities. Human (anthropogenic) changes to phytoplankton impact both
                        natural
                        and
                        economic processes.[77]</p><br>
